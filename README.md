# S1-Labyrinth
This is my first university project, coded with GigaJdzz.
It's a labyrinth game coded in Python with the Turtle Library.

This program features both manual navigation using the arrow keys and an automatic pathfinding algorithm.

To launch, please download all the files, and execute the file 'ProgrammePrincipal'.

To create your own .laby file, use '#' for walls, '.' for crossings, 'x' for the starting point and 'X' for the ending point.

NOTE: This code is not very advanced. Expect a lot of bugs and errors.
